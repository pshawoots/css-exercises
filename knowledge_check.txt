External, Internal, Inline CSS difference? 

External CSS is when you have an external CSS file where you do all your styling.
Internal CSS is adding rules to the .html file in the head element.
Inline CSS is adding rules to the element call itself.

Class Selectors: .class1, .class2, ...; ID Selectors: #html-element-ID

Single Rule for 2 different selectors
div,
p {
    color: white;
}

single rule for element with id="title" and class="primary"
#title.primary {
    color: white;
}

descendent combinators apply rule only to selector if it has with ancestor that 
matches the previous selector.

class selector (.) has higher specificity than rule with three type (element name)
selectors.
